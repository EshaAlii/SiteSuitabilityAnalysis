# SiteSuitabilityAnalysis
Project to identify two sites to serve as future docking areas in Lake Yosemite in Merced CA. 


The primariy goal of the site suitability analysis is to identify two potential sites to serve as future docking areas. This will be accomplished through the calculation of surface volume using two interpolation methods: Kriging and IDW. The area where this site suitabilty analysis will take place is along the Eastern shore of Lake Yosemite in Merced, California. The lake itself is surrounded by multiple vernal pools along with a road that runs along the south eastern side of the lake itself. The specific criteria that must be met within this site suitabiilty analysis are as follows: Eevation between referenced low and high water years, minimum area of 15 m by 30 m for development, cannot be within 8 meters of a protected vernal pool, within 100 m of an exisitng road.
